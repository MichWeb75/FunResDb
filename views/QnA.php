                    <b>FunResDb</b> is a curated database integrating published information on <i>A. fumigatus </i> CYP51A mutations. Although we carefully extract information from published resources we cannot guarantee that all information is correct. For this purpose, users of <b>FunResDb</b> should always check the original publications (links to PubMed are provided by <b>FunResDb</b>). Furthermore, phenotypic resistance can occur through different mechanisms. In some patient cohorts, up to 43% of  <i>A. fumigatus </i> strains resistant to azoles have been found to have wild-type CYP51A (Bueid et al., 2010). Therefore, identification of a wild-type CYP51A sequence does not automatically infer susceptibility. If you identify mistakes in <b>FunResDb</b>, we are grateful if you let us know and will try to continuously improve the database.

                        All the data has been extracted by careful reading of published literature which investigated azole resistance of clinically relevant strains of <i>A. fumigatus</i>. Published information was extracted from the manuscript following the interpretation of the authors. As methods used for susceptibility testing as well as breakpoints used for data interpretation may differ between published studies, we refer our users to the original publications that can easily be accessed via our database.

                            <p class="large"> All the data has been extracted by careful reading of published literature which investigated azole resistance of clinically relevant strains of Aspergillus  fumigatus. Azoles are a group of antifungal drugs, which are frequently used and therefore become more likely to show less susceptibilty by the fungus. For the most common azoles (Itraconazole, Voriconazole, Posaconazole, Isavuconazole. ) the so-called MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) is experimentally determined in the paper. According to MIC threshold criteria proposed by Kurzai et al., the given Aspergillus strain is then classified as sensitive (S), intermediate (I), resistant (R).

                        A DNA or protein sequence of <i>A. fumigatus</i> CYP51A serves as input for the database. In case of DNA sequence, the exon structure is determined by the algorithm in order translate the coding nucleotides into the corresponding amino acids. Next, the given protein sequence is compared to a wild-type sequence to detect amino acid substitutions and output their positions. The result are mutation identifiers which consist of three parts: wild-typ amino acid, position in the protein sequence, mutated amino acid (e.g. L46T; WT: leucine at position 46; mutated to tyrosine). Mutation identifiers can be searched in the database to retrieve documented <i>A. fumigatus</i> strains which contain those patterns.

                        The cyp51a Gene can be amplified with 3 primer-pairs (i.e. Cyp1-L/Cyp1-R, Cyp2-L/Cyp2-R, Cyp3-L/Cyp3-R (Chen et al.2005)), Cyp1-L and Cyp3-R being located outside the coordinated region. The amplification is carried out as described (Chen et al. 2005) with an elevated number of cycles : 95°C 5min, 36 cycles 95°C 30sec, 58°C 30sec, 72°C 1min; one cycle 72°C 10min. PCR approach using commercial ingredients. Sequencing of the 3 products is done with both primers each. Because of the fact that, with both primer-pairs, overlapping regions are being amplified, the gene-sequence is completely available after sequencing. For sequencing the tandem-repeat in the promoter region, i.e. the primer-pair A5/A7 (Mellado et al. 2001) can be used.
